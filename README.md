# tg2obsidian

This program ("Bot") uses Telegram's free bot functionality in order to save messages from a Telegram group to the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault on your local computer.

The Markdown markup used will also work for most [other programs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/) that work with local Markdown files.

The Bot is designed to run locally on the computer where the Obsidian files are located.

This readme is also available [in Russian](README.ru.md) with more details.
The details in English will appear here soon.

## Use case

- You are typing or recording messages in your personal Telegram group _on the go_
- Bot receives new messages from Telegram and saves them as Inbox notes in your PKM vault
- _Afterwards, in a quiet environment_, you process those notes, moving the information from them to appropriate places in your vault
